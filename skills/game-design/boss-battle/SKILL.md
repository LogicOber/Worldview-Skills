# Boss Battle Designer

Design a boss the player will remember, and produce the assets and video that prove it.

## What a boss is

A boss is not a strong enemy. A boss is an enemy whose **rules change**, so the player has to change too. Every phase adds a signature skill that normal attacks cannot answer; every signature skill has a specific counter; every counter costs something. The fight is a conversation, not a health bar.

This skill designs that conversation first, and only then designs the monster.

## What the user gets

| Deliverable | Format |
|---|---|
| Boss design document | phases, skills, telegraphs, counters, cost, arena logic |
| Boss reference sheet | 3-panel (front / back / detail) in the project's locked style |
| Boss action board | 4-panel: wind-up · signature skill · being countered · phase break |
| Arena plate | 3/4-angle location with spatial lock and named landmarks |
| Hero ability board (if heroes exist) | normal attack vs special ability, visibly different |
| Cutscene or fight video | 10–30 s per phase, generated with `film-action-combat` rules |
| Music cue | optional, after picture lock |

## What the user has to do

1. Describe the boss and the world in a sentence or two.
2. Pick a visual style by letter if the project has none yet.
3. Approve the one-page design (phases + counters) before assets are generated.
4. Pick takes by number.

The skill decides archetype, arena, phase count, telegraph timing, action density and camera intensity. It states them. It does not ask.

## How it runs

   ▼
film-style-library   → style locked (skipped if project already has style.json)
   ▼
boss design pass     → design.md (this skill; see template below)  ← gate: approve
   ▼
film-character-sheet → boss sheet; hero sheets if heroes are named
film-prop-sheet      → boss weapon; any artefact that matters (a core, a relic)
film-location   → arena plate + spatial lock
action boards → boss 4-panel; hero abilities 4-panel (gpt-image-2)
   ▼
film-shot-prompt + film-action-combat → one prompt per phase (10–30 s each)
   ▼
film-generate-review → ×2 per phase in parallel, review by beat, lock, assemble
```

## Design template (`design.md`)

```markdown
# <Boss name>

## Identity
One sentence: who this was, what it is now, why it is here.
(A boss with a past is a boss the player feels something about when it falls.)

## Archetype
giant / assassin / caster / swarm-master / mirror  → sets default rhythm

## Arena
Name · size · 3–5 fixed landmarks · what can break · where the player can stand

## Phases

### Phase 1 — <name>  (100–66 % HP)
Normal attacks: <2–3, grounded, readable>
Signature skill: <name>
  Telegraph: <what the player sees, 0.5–1.0 s before>
  Area / target: <cone, ring, line, grab>
  Consequence if hit: <knockback, freeze, damage type>
  Counter: <specific hero ability, not "dodge">
  Cost of countering: <cooldown, position, resource>
Phase break: <what visibly changes — armour cracks, eyes shift, arena breaks>

### Phase 2 — ...
### Phase 3 — ...

## The win and its cost
What the player gets. What the world loses. (The core was also a person. The
arena is destroyed. The ally who held the line does not stand up.)

## Video plan
Phase → duration → density → camera → key frames
```

## Rules this entry enforces

- **Phases before pixels.** No boss sheet is generated until the phase table is approved. A boss designed as a picture first is a statue.
- **Signature skill ≠ normal attack.** On the action board and in every prompt, the two must be visibly different in stance, scale and light. If a viewer cannot tell which is which in one frame, redesign.
- **Every skill has a telegraph.** 0.5–1.0 s of readable wind-up. A boss that hits without warning is unfair in a game and unreadable in a video.
- **Counters are specific.** "The mage's constellation shield freezes the ring shockwave" — not "the party dodges."
- **Physics rules from `film-action-combat` apply.** Anchors, four-part strikes, causality, momentum, landmarks.
- **A cost is mandatory.** The design is rejected if the win is free.
